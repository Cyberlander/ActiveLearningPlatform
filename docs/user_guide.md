### Get a comment
When you open the page for the first time there isn't any comment loaded yet.
Click on the blue button in the middle of the page to retrieve a new comment.

### Label a comment
Below the actual comment you will find three litte buttons with good, neutral and
bad on it.  Use them to label the comment. You will see that the border of the
comment will change according to the label. Now there appears another blue button
in the middle "Save labeled comment". Press it to store the comment in the backend
table and retrieve another unlabeled one.
